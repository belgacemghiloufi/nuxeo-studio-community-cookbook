# Automation Script utilities


## Prerequisites

- None

## Description

Miscellaneous utilities to be used with JS Automation.

## Usage

Look at the script you need and copy/paste it in your Studio project. The comments in the "header" explain how to use it.

- Make sure to set the `input`  and the `output` of your script as expected in the comments.
- Don't forget to explicitly declare the parameter(s). They also are described in the comments.

    <td>FollowLifecycleTransition throws an error if the Document is in a state that does not allow following the transition. When bulk updating a list of documents, we may want to avoid that.</td>

## Installation

### Studio Modeler

Create the automation script(s) and copy the content from the original(s). You can of course change the names to fit your naming convention.
