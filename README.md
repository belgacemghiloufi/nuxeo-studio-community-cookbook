# Nuxeo Studio Custom Elements

This repository aims at helping the Nuxeo community to enrich Nuxeo Studio projects. It provides a list of features and visual elements ready to be copy-pasted. The modules are for LTS 2019:

- They can be unrelated to the UI (to provide new backend features, such as new conversions).
- They can be related to provide elements for Nuxeo Web UI, or any frontend applications

## Getting Started

There is nothing to build. Each module generally contains:

- XML extension, Page providers, Automation chain or automation scripting into Nuxeo Studio Modeler
- Layouts, contributions within the Nuxeo Bundle file,  HTML resources, medias that should be created in Nuxeo Studio Designer.

You can clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-studio-custom-elements.git
```

### Prerequisites

A **Nuxeo Studio Account** as well as an **active Nuxeo Studio Project** is needed. You can create an account from our [registration page](https://connect.nuxeo.com/register/#/) and benefit from a free 30-day trial to get access to:

- Nuxeo Studio, the web-based configuration and customization environment
- Nuxeo Marketplace, the application store with ready-to-install plugins and packages

## Contributing

Each new module should be created in a new folder. You should include a readme with your module to explain how it works. You should update this file with a one sentence explanation of the module.

## Support

These features are not part of the Nuxeo Production platform.

These solutions are provided for inspiration and we encourage customers to use them as code samples and learning resources.

This is a moving project (no API maintenance, no deprecation process, etc.) If any of these solutions are found to be useful for the Nuxeo Platform in general, they will be integrated directly into platform, not maintained here.
