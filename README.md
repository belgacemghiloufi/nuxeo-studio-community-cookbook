# Nuxeo Studio Custom Elements

This repository aims at helping the Nuxeo Community to enrich Nuxeo Studio projects. It provides a list of features and visual elements ready to be copy-pasted. The modules are for **LTS 2019**:

- They can be unrelated to the UI (to provide new backend features, such as utilities to handle multimedia files, specific conversions, email templates etc.).
- They can provide UI elements for Nuxeo Web UI, or any frontend application.

## Module listing

For reasons of clarity, all the **contributions are referenced** in a [dedicated page](https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-studio-custom-elements/tree/master/modules). Each module is categorized by:

- Contributor
- Nuxeo Server version
- Feature category
- Required addons

## Getting Started

There is nothing to build. Each module generally contains:

- XML extension, page providers, automation chain or automation scripting into Nuxeo Studio Modeler.
- Layouts, contributions within the Nuxeo bundle file,  HTML resources, medias that should be created in Nuxeo Studio Designer.

You can clone the repository locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-studio-custom-elements.git
```

### Prerequisites

A **Nuxeo Studio Account** as well as an **active Nuxeo Studio Project** is needed. You can create an account from our [registration page](https://connect.nuxeo.com/register/#/) and benefit from a free 30-day trial to get access to:

## Repository Structuration

- If you're a partner, create your partner folder under `/modules/partners/` if it doesn't exist already. Then, create the readme file to present your company and your contributions. We provide a [README-PARTNER.MD template](https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-studio-custom-elements/blob/master/toolkit-and-guidelines/README-PARTNER.md).
- Create a README file to present your module, using the [README-MODULE.MD template](https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-studio-custom-elements/blob/master/toolkit-and-guidelines/README-MODULE.md).
- Create a `/modeler` and `/designer` folders to upload respectively resources from Nuxeo Studio Modeler and Nuxeo Studio Designer.
